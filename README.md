A beginner-friendly chatbot built with LangChain and Ollama (Mistral model) that answers capital city questions based on user input.
Build using:
- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (running Mistral model locally)
- Python
  
Features:
- Uses LangChain prompt templates
- Powered by Mistral (via Ollama)
- No API key or internet required
- Local, free, and beginner-friendly

How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install langchain-community
2. Install Ollama
3. Run Ollama and pull the mistral model:

4. Run the capital_bot.py

This is built as part of my journey learning how to create LLM-based assistants using LangChain and local models like Mistral.
